# Dead Code Society

Welcome to Dead Code Society - a friendly reminder to all developers that the best code is often the code you delete. This project serves as a lighthearted manifesto for maintaining clean, efficient codebases by identifying and removing unused code.

## Our Mission

In the spirit of digital minimalism, we're here to remind you that:
- Every line of dead code is a burden on future maintainers
- Commented-out code is like digital hoarding
- If you haven't used it in months, you probably won't need it
